  measurement: "km/h"
}; // velocity (km/h)

const acc = {
  value: 3,
  measurement: "m/s^2"
}; // acceleration (m/s^2)

const time = {
  value: 3600,
  measurement: "seconds"
}; // seconds (1 hour)

const d = {
  value: 0,
  measurement: "kilometers"}; // distance (km)

const fuel = {
  value: 5000,
  measurement: "kilograms"
}; // remaining fuel (kg)

const fbr = {
  value: 0.5,
  measurement: "kg/s"
}; // fuel burn rate (kg/s)


const d2 = d + (vel*time) //calcultes new distance
const rf = fbr*time //calculates remaining fuel

// Pick up an error with how the function below is called and make it robust to such errors
